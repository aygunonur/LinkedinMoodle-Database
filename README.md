# LinkedinMoodle-Database


We've designed a database model which name is LinkedinMoodle for the virtually integrated version of the popular web applications Linkedin and Moodle.

Member is a super class. Everyone registered on the system is a member. Members must be a person or an organisation. If it is a person, it can be students and instructors using 
the Moodle system or just a member using LinkedIn. If it is an organisation, it must be companies or universities. Each person and organization must have its own profile page. Moreover, we matched the profiles of every person registered with Moodle to their LinkedIn profile.

In our model, the condition of passing the course at the university depends on the grades they get from the projects. Students can share the grades from their projects as a post on Linkedin, if they want. 

We also integrated the universities registered in Moodle by including them in Linkedin.
